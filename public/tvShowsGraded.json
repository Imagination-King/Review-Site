Their only goal in life is to have fun and cause mischief wherever they go, whether that's around the world, across time, or at home on the Warner Bros lot. Joining them are a whole host of other characters, including Dr. Scratchansniff, Ralph the Security Guard, Pinky and the Brain, Slappy and Skippy, and many others.",
        "Review": "The Warners' zaniness is in full swing here. Plus, the large cast of supporting characters ensures there's always a nice variety of skits to entertain everyone. Some jokes don't land as well anymore, (especially those referencing then-current celebrities and politicians), but most jokes still hold up over 20 years later. My personal favorite is Rita and Runt, the cat-and-dog duo who are looking for a new home (and singing all the way)."

Everyone's favorite lab mice are back too, trying once again to take over the world on a nightly basis.",
        "Review": "This revival fails to do the original justice. While the characters still retain their original zany behavior, a lot of their classic punchlines have been deflated by more modern sensibilities of what is appropriate (the most notable example is the removal of Yakko's famous \"Hello Nurse\" line). Also, the new supporting cast they use to break up the Warners' shorts never brought as much to the table as classic characters like Slappy Squirrel, the mafia pigeons, or even Chicken Boo."

Myne being physically weak and still striving toward her goals is admirable, and the viewer can't help but root for her to succeed. Overall, a very well written show with a likeable-enough main character and decently fleshed-out supporting characters. It's nowhere near perfect, but it's cute, fun, and relaxing. And sometimes, that's all you need in a show. "

The push-and-pull dynamic between those two is masterfully done. However, about halfway through the show, something happens that, without spoiling anything, makes the show feel less suspenseful. The second half of the show is still good, but it never reaches the same high as the first half."

Seeing the relationships between the Gen Lock team develop as they faced Nemesis was definitely a highlight. There was a shift, however, for Season 2, and it was not a good shift. The story got weirder, subject matter got darker, and some sex scenes were added. The shift probably occured because the season initially aired on HBO, but whatever the reason, I'm not a fan."

The main characters were unique and had fun interactions, but the fight scenes were never anything to write home about. Then, after the time jump, it felt like all of the initial charm had been sucked out, and most of the characters I'd grown to care about were gone or significantly different. And to top it all off, the finale was very unsatisfying, not giving any of the main characters a happy ending."

But I was enticed by the prospect of seeing Matt Smith (of Doctor Who fame) again, plus one of the actresses was cute. However, it didn't take long for me to remember that this was a Game of Thrones spin-off. With rampant gore, sex, and a cast of self-centered characters continuously back-stabbing each other, I wish I'd listened to common sense."

The \"what if Superman was evil\" story has been done so many times, across various media, that it would have taken something truly special to make this one stand out. Unfortunately, Invincible contains no such element. The casting of J.K. Simmons as Omni-Man was brilliant, but aside from that, there is nothing truly groundbreaking or unique here to keep me invested."

However, all of that is tainted by the excessive amounts of \"fanservice\". I hesitate to even call it fanservice, as a lot of the time, it's straight-up barely-covered nudity. This means that this (potentially) A+ Tier show is relegated to the lowest levels of this list so that it will not be a stumbling block for other people struggling with a porn addiction."

With the original movie's cast plus a handful of new additions, and Alan Menken returning as composer, this show is a treat for fans of Tangled, Disney, or musicals."

It's not bad, but it's also nothing special. The best way to describe it is to say that it's a well-written, but somewhat forgettable fanfiction."

The premise of a ghost stuck at her high school trying to solve her own murder was so intriguing, and this show really delivered. While I was able to predict some of the twists and turns, there were still plenty of curveballs that had me constantly guessing as to what would happen next. Also, the main cast of characters, both ghost and non-ghost, all have compelling stories to tell and secrets to uncover."

If you want a good adaptation of Secret Invasion, go watch Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes."

The concept of Weapons and Meisters fighting witches is interesting, and the main characters are certainly memorable, but the story is just kind of, I don't know. Forgettable? Run-of-the-mill? It's not a bad story, it's just not anything special, espcially by anime standards. Also, if you have a problem with spiders or snakes you should probably stay away."

Most of the episodes are well-made and are a fun exploration of different sides of the Star Wars universe that we don't usually see.

However, two things really hurt the show: one, they either couldn't or wouldn't use most of Superman's rogues gallery, which means they had to make do with the bottom of the barrel. Issue two, the writers seemed more interested in using the show as a political platform, which caused the plot to feel tacked on, especially in later seasons."

It is nice to hear the original cast members reprise their roles, but the characters have become extremely simplified versions of their old selves. Teen Titans GO! can be an enjoyable show, but if you're looking for a continuation of the original, you'd be best to keep searching."

The story is well-written, and I actually really like the actors, but I cannot recommend this show. I only watched it as long as I did because Erin Moriarty (Starlight's actress) is pretty, but even then, it was not worth it. I should have called it quits after the first five minutes of episode 1."

Korra fails to live up to the standard set by The Last Airbender, not because the characters are badly written or because of the lack of elements and characters from TLA, but because the story isn't cohesive. Not to spoil anything, but seasons 1 and 2 have pretty high stakes, and then seasons 3 and 4 come along with much lowest stakes. Granted, the last two seasons are pretty good, but getting to that point is a rough ride."
